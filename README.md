## üöÄ Overview

Welcome to **`PythonTextAnalyzer`**! This is a simple yet effective Python script designed to analyze textual input. It counts the total number of **alphabetical characters** (both uppercase and lowercase) and the number of **non-empty lines** provided by the user.

This project is a personal learning endeavor, allowing me to explore fundamental Python concepts like:
* **Input/Output Handling**: Gracefully managing user input until EOF.
* **String Manipulation**: Utilizing methods like `strip()` for cleaning text data.
* **Character Encoding**: Working with `ord()` to understand character Unicode values.
* **Looping and Conditionals**: Efficiently iterating through text and applying logic.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Alphabetical Character Count**: Accurately counts all English alphabet characters (a-z, A-Z).
* **Non-Empty Line Count**: Identifies and counts lines that contain actual content after removing leading/trailing whitespace.
* **Interactive Input**: Takes multi-line input from the user until an EOF signal is received (e.g., `Ctrl+D` on Linux/macOS, `Ctrl+Z` then `Enter` on Windows).

## üíª How to Use

To run this script, simply execute it from your terminal:

1.  **Clone the repository (optional, if you want the files locally):**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/youngkoorosh/PythonTextAnalyzer.git](https://github.com/youngkoorosh/PythonTextAnalyzer.git)
    cd PythonTextAnalyzer
    ```

2.  **Run the script:**
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
    (Assuming your script is named `main.py` or similar)

3.  **Provide your input:**
    Type your lines of text. Press `Enter` after each line.
    To signal the end of input:
    * **Linux/macOS:** Press `Ctrl + D`
    * **Windows:** Press `Ctrl + Z`, then `Enter`

4.  **See the results:**
    The script will then print the total count of non-empty lines and alphabetical characters.

## üõ†Ô∏è Development & Learning

This project is a testament to my journey in Python programming. As a 19-year-old developer passionate about Python, I'm constantly learning and applying new concepts. This script serves as a practical exercise in:
* Understanding built-in functions (`ord()`, `input()`, `print()`).
* Mastering string methods (`.strip()`).
* Implementing robust input loops with error handling (`try-except`).

I'm always open to feedback, suggestions, or discussions on how to improve this project or future ones!
